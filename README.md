# HLibWKHTMLToX
(Very) Low-level Haskell bindings to libwkhtmltox using the Haskell FFI. Requires a local copy of libwkhtmltox.

Still V alpha, and only the wkhtmltoimage bindings are written... wkhtmltopdf bindings coming soon.

After HLibWKHTMLToX is finished, the plan right now is to create a higher-level more idomatic bindings (like hlibsass and HSass) on top of HLibWKHTMLToX
